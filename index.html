          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              I am a full-stack Web Development student with previous experience in IT and as a paralegal.
            </p>
            <p>
              I grew up in California and graduated from San Clemente High School. I have been developing for about 9 months now, and
              I have always been interested in computers. My older brother, who owns a web hosting company, built me my first computer
              when I was about 12 which sparked my interest into the tech industry as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I decided to pursue a career in web development, I worked in the legal field as a case-assistant which led me to
              acquire a paralegalâ€™s certificate while working full time. As a paralegal I had to learn to manage my time, use critical
              thinking to find solutions to unexpected problems, provide excellent customer service to client's going through some of
              the most stressful situations of their lives, and communicate with teammates, clients, and opposing counsel to ensure
              deadlines are met. I have come to understand that the skills I developed while working in this field have helped me with
              my everyday life and will with my next career as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realized I wanted to pursue a career in tech while running the firm's IT for my previous employer. I then began
              teaching myself some Python to determine if programming was a path I wanted to pursue. After a few weeks of making
              simple functions in Python, I decided that I would get formally educated for Web Development. I enrolled in an
              accelerated web development program at LearningFuze, where I worked extensively on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and
              completed the program in May 2020.
